"simuation_code.c" runs an equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model at a given temperature, using 
the Metropolis algorithm.
 
To run a simulation:

- The "input.txt" file contains de following data: L (linear size of the lattice), T (temperature), n_mcs (number of MCS), 
n_meas (number of MCS between two consecutive measurements), seed (seed of the RNG) (each number in a different row). 

- Once the values of these parameters have been stablished, you can open "simulation_code.c". 
The initial configuration is randomly generated by default. If you want to start from a particular 
configuration, you can use the function "lee_configuracion" (which is currently commented) 
and the name of the .txt file in which the configuration is stored. The .txt file should contain 
one spin (+1 or -1) per row.

- The time series of the simulation will be stored in a file called "evolution.txt". This file will 
contain one row for each measurement, and three columns: time (in MCS), energy, magnetization.



Using the data from the time series, the statistics code computes the averages of energy and magnetization
and estimates their error using the binning method. It does this for different bin sizes (1, 2, 4, 8...).
To do statistical analysis of generated data:

- Open "statistis_code.c" and, in lines 36 and 45, change "evolution.txt" by the name of the file where
your time series is stored (you may have changed the name of the "simulation_code" output file).

- The results of the statistical analyisis will be stored in a file called "error_vs_binning_size.txt".
It contains one row for each binning, and 5 columns: m (the size of the bins), E (sample mean of energy),
sample variance of the sample mean of energy (in other words, sample variance of energy divided by 
number of bins), sample mean of modulus of magnetization, sample variance of sample mean of modulus of
magnetization.
(If you want the error of the mean for a particular binning, you need to take the square-root of 
the value stored in this file).
